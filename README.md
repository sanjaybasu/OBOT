Although office-based opioid treatment with buprenorphine is a cost-effective and clinically effective therapy for opioid use disorder, the impact of offering this treatment on primary care practice finances is uncertain. This study aimed to estimate how office-based opioid treatment with buprenorphine would be expected to financially impact primary care practices under each of four typical delivery approaches. Based on interviews with N = 20 primary care practices of varying sizes and types, we identified four distinct approaches for delivering office-based opioid treatment with buprenorphine. We then incorporated the operational details of each approach into a microsimulation model that sampled from national datasets on personnel, overhead, and claims to assess the cost and revenue implications of each approach for practice finances generally.
